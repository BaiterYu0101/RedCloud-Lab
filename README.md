# RedCloud-Lab
Hi, I'm Baiter, a cybersecurity student passionate about **Red Teaming** and **Cloud Security**.

This repository showcases my hands-on learning journey through TryHackMe, Hack The Box, AWS/Azure misconfiguration labs, and certification notes. I'm committed to continuous growth and building practical skills in offensive security and cloud-based attack surfaces.

---

## 🔴 Red Teaming Projects
- Write-ups of real-world vulnerable machines (TryHackMe & Hack The Box)
- Tool usage and analysis: Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit, etc.
- Privilege escalation, lateral movement, web exploitation

## ☁️ Cloud Security Labs
- AWS misconfiguration demos (S3, IAM, Lambda, etc.)
- Terraform, Kubernetes and serverless attack surfaces (in progress)
- Cloud security architecture & detection tips

## 🧠 Certification Notes
- [x] ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)
- [ ] CEH (In Progress)
- [ ] OSCP (Target: Q4 2025)

> Every file in this repo represents hours of curiosity, frustration, persistence, and growth. Let's hack and learn together.
